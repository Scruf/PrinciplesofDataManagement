Contributions:
Zach: I worked on the combat and NPC section of the game, as well as fleshing out quests, Dungeons, entering/exiting buildings

Colton: I worked on the loot section of the game, general menu options (map, inventory, quests, help, quit),
and locations and quests sections as needed for final product. I also created a large portion of overall gameflow for
the console (including the sick ASCII art you see at the start/end of the game)

Egor: I worked on the locations and also web scrapers to aggregate the data which later was used in the game.
Also set up MySQL server on the Linode
