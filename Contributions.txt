Contributions:
Zach: I worked on the combat section of the game as well as fleshing out quests, Dungeons, entering/exiting buildings and NPCs
Colton:
Egor: I worked on the locations and also web scrapers to aggregate the data which later was used in the game . Also set up MySQL server on the Linode
Shalimar: I helped with hammering out the design early on and promoting discussion, though when it came down to it, I got busy the last week when the team began to get together to code it, and was unavailable for meetings, which limited my effectiveness. (Schedule's didn't align properly)
