In order to run the program first youll need to install the pymysql and tabulate by using this commands “pip3 install pymysql” and “pip3 install tabulate”


For a DungenKnigts project our stack consist of Python3 and MySQL server . For interaction with MySQL server we used Datagrip which allowed us to use database easily. We were able to create queries, procedures and views more easily as opposed of using shell to connect to MySQL directly. Also it allows us to see a data in our table with doing a projections. Also we used pymysql to run the queries and stored procedures. For some repeated queries we created stored procedures which allowed us to make our code more succinct and readable. MySQL server was deployed on the ubuntu image which was provided by Linode.com. We also used web scraping to get random data which we used for NPCS , Towns and Monsters. As for the code we used OOP principals to split our game into multiple classes which we are using as well as creating some helper method along the way.
